/**
 * The three cards that are not recipes, at the top of the items column:
 * a generator (the power catalog), a custom rate node, a crop farm. They
 * lived on the board's build tray until 2026-09-06, when the tray ran out
 * of room for the mode keys; this column is where you go to add things,
 * so this is where they belong.
 *
 * Quiet on purpose (Jack, 2026-09-06): the column's own key face (the
 * search box's border and ground), no plate behind the row and no colour
 * on the icons, so they read as three things you can put down and not as
 * a section of the column. `leading` is the column's own fold-away key,
 * which sits at the row's start rather than in the search box.
