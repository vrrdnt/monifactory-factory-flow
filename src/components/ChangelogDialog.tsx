/**
 * What's new: what THIS reader missed, and the rest of the history behind a
 * button.
 *
 * The whole list used to render at once. That is fine at four entries and
 * hostile at eighty: someone who last opened the planner in the spring came
 * back to a wall and closed it, which loses exactly the person the popup
 * exists for. So the sheet opens on the releases they have not seen - usually
 * one to four - and the archive is one click below, for the reader who came
 * looking for it rather than the one who was handed it.
 *
 * The VERSION leads each entry. It is the thing a reader arrives holding - the
 * chip in the header told them theirs, a bug report asks for it - so entries
 * are anchored on the number and date in a rail down the left.
 *
 * Opened ON REQUEST only, from the version chip or the Welcome tab. It used
 * to arrive by itself after a release carrying a warning, dressed as an
 * interruption, with a second box guarding its close until the warning was
 * read; both were removed (Jack, 2026-09-08). A warning still renders as an
 * amber block inside its entry.
