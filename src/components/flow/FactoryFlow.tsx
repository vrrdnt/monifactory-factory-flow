/**
 * The one board-level thing worth interrupting for: a ring of machines that

 *
 * It earns a notice where other problems do not, because a spiral is the only
 * failure whose cause is nowhere in particular. A bottleneck is ON a card, so
 * the card can say it. A ring's cause is the ring, and every card in it can
 * only point at the next one, so at a hundred machines the board reads as a
 * field of zeros with no author. Hence: state the ring once, in one place,
 * and say plainly that the planner is right and the game would do this too.
 *
 * Dismissal is keyed to the ring's identity, so waving this one away does not
 * silence the NEXT spiral you build.

 * A closed plan has to say where every ingredient comes from and where every
 * product goes, so an unwired slot is not a fault to scold - it is work not
 * done yet, and the honest thing is to say how much of it is left and offer to
 * take you there. Chalk-white to match the mark on the cards themselves (see
 * --verdict-unwired-ink), never the alert reds and ambers: this is a checklist,
 * not an alarm.
 *
 * Not dismissible, deliberately, and it disappears by itself the moment the
 * last slot is connected - which is the only ending it has.

/**
 * Owns the hop map: what the pointer is resting on, and when to paint from it.
 *
 * NOT React Flow's `onNodeMouseEnter`, which is where this feature first went
 * and where it did not work. While the board is being panned or zoomed the
 * whole nodes layer is `pointer-events: none` (globals.css), so the natural
 * gesture — wheel out until the cards go to glance, then look at the one under
 * the cursor — produces no node-enter event at all: the pointer entered the
 * card before the zoom, when there was nothing to map, and it never crosses a
 * node boundary again afterwards. The board sat there doing nothing.
 *
 * A plain `mousemove` plus a hit-test asks the question the right way round:
 * not "did you cross into a card" but "what are you on now". Every nudge of the
 * hand re-arms it, so the map appears whatever order the zooming and the moving
 * happened in. It is also what gives the settle for free — each move restarts
 * the timer, so it only fires once the pointer has actually stopped, and
 * sweeping across the board maps nothing on the way.
 *
 * Glance state is read from the board's own attribute rather than from
 * node-detail's published level. Same value, but it is the one thing here that
 * is provably in force: it is what CSS is using to draw the glance view.
 *
 * The short wait before painting is per CARD — see `pendingId` below for why
 * that distinction is the difference between "instant" and "sluggish".
