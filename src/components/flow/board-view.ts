/**
 * Board view settings: how the canvas looks, and which of the read-only display
 * modes are on.
 *
 * This module holds the LIVE settings, the ones the board is drawing with right
 * now, in localStorage and outside the Zustand store so they can be read
 * without an effect.
 *
 * They are not global taste, though. How a factory is drawn belongs to the
 * factory: one build wants rate labels and fat lines, the next wants a clean
 * board, and a plan that was dressed to be readable should still be wearing
 * that when you come back to it. So a snapshot goes into every design as it is
 * saved and comes back out when you switch to it (`plan-view.ts`, and
 * `showProject` in the design store), which is the same snapshot a SHARED setup
 * has always carried. Switching tabs therefore rewrites what is here — the
 * localStorage copy is what the board reads, not the record of what any one
 * plan wants.
 *
 * The columns and the resource marks deliberately do NOT work this way; see
 * PlanViewScope.
 *
 * Read through useSyncExternalStore: localStorage does not exist during SSR,
 * so the server renders the defaults and the browser swaps in the saved values
 * on hydration. That is the one shape that neither mismatches the server HTML
 * nor sets state from inside an effect.
