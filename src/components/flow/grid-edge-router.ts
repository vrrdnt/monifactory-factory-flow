/**
 * The grid edge router.
 *
 * Wires live on the same 20px grid the cards are built from (`board-grid.ts`):
 * every straight run of every wire travels along a grid line - horizontal,
 * vertical, or one of the two 45° diagonals through the grid's vertices -
 * and no run ever comes within one cell of a card. The one sanctioned
 * exception is the port stub: the last hop from a card's margin to the port
 * itself, which by definition has to cross the margin.
 *
 * A grid line is a LANE with a usable width (16px on the orthogonal lines,
 * 10px on the closer-packed diagonals). Wires are fractions of a lane, and
 * wires whose fractions fit side by side SHARE the lane, packed around the
 * line's centre with a 2px gap. A full lane costs heavily, which pushes
 * latecomers into the next line over - overlap is never chosen while any
 * separated path exists. Only the port stubs may stack, because arbitrarily
 * many wires can meet one port.
 *
 * THE WIRES PLAN TOGETHER. Each wire is one A* over the grid, but the solve
 * is one thing: docks are planned per card before anything routes
 * (`planDocks`), every crossing of an earlier wire costs (`T.crossing`), and
 * wires that still cross are ripped up and routed again against the finished
 * board with the contested spots dearer each round (negotiation). See
 * `solveGridRoutes`.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its inputs: flow-space geometry in,
 * polylines out. No DOM, no React, no viewport - the same inputs give the
 * same routes at every zoom, which is the routing invariant ARCHITECTURE.md
 * demands. The host feeds it published geometry and caches the result by
 * content fingerprint.

 * 80px out of its way to avoid one. The rules the numbers encode:
 *
 * - Sharing a lane costs a little MORE than an empty one, so wires travel
 *   in ribbons a lane apart rather than on each other's shoulders; a full
 *   lane costs a lot, so overlap is never chosen while a detour exists.
 * - A 45° bend is well under a 90° corner, so corners get cut with a
 *   diagonal whenever there is room; a reversal is dear and only waypoint
 *   excursions ever pay it.
 * - A wire leaves a port straight and lands straight for `cleanCells`
 *   cells; bending inside that run costs `earlyTurn` on top of the turn.
 * - Crossing another wire costs more than a couple of turns, and the
 *   negotiation makes contested spots dearer each round.
 * - Docks are planned per card; leaving the plan costs per pixel of rim.
 *
 * Solves are synchronous and never nested, so the active tuning lives in
