/**
 * How much of the board is worth drawing at the current zoom.
 *
 * Zoomed out, a card's contents are noise: the slot sprites are sub-pixel, the
 * dials are a grey smear, the machine name is three pixels tall, and a rate
 * chip is a smudge. So past a threshold the board switches to a glance view —
 * machines show how hard they are running, buffers show what is in them, and
 * lines are just their routes.
 *
 * ONE step, and one threshold, for everything. Nodes and edges used to decide
 * separately: nodes had a hysteretic threshold and edges a plain one, so
 * between the two there was a zone where the rate chips had come back but the
 * cards were still showing percentages. Detail switching in pieces reads as the
 * board glitching. There is now a single level, held here, that both consume.
 *
 * TUNING: the two numbers below are the whole control surface. They are a pair
 * rather than one value because a single boundary flickers — a board parked
 * exactly on it flips detail on and off with every sub-pixel of zoom drift. The
 * gap is the dead zone that stops that, and it is deliberately narrow: too wide
 * and regaining detail means zooming noticeably further in than the point where
 * you lost it, which feels like the board is arguing with you.
 *
 * Nothing here may change a node's SIZE. Detail is dropped with `visibility`,
 * never `display`, so every element keeps its layout box: the router measures
 * node bounds and slot anchors through those boxes, and a card that changed
 * shape with zoom would reroute the board every time you scrolled the wheel —
 * exactly the viewport-dependent routing ARCHITECTURE.md forbids.
