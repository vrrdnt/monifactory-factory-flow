/**
 * When the board's two top toolbars fold into their single-button triggers.
 *
 * Compact mode folds them for a phone, but a desktop board can be just as
 * short of room: the side columns take 676px of the window, and the two rows
 * together want 833px on top of their margins. On a 1400px window they
 * crossed, and the paint tray sat unreachable UNDER the POWER tray. So the
 * fold is decided by the BOARD's own width, not the window's, and it happens
 * one side at a time: the paint row folds first (it is the one visited
 * less, and folding it frees 400px), and the build row only when the board
 * cannot hold even that.
 *
 * The widths are the rows as measured on the live board, each side's 12px
 * margin, and a cell of daylight between them. A fold does not shrink a row
 * to one button: the build fold keeps undo/redo out (124px with the trigger),
 * and the paint fold keeps the bin, the view keys and the export keys out
 * (280px). Each threshold is what the board needs to hold the row ABOVE it
 * once the previous fold has happened.

// key beside it while auto is off): 286 shell px measured with both keys
// out, 250 with the toggle alone. The wider state decides the fold.
