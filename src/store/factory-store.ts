/**
 * A deleted drawer's wires HEAL (Jack, 2026-09-08: "it's two edges going

 * cards the drawer stood between are wired straight to each other, which
 * is exactly the undo of the board menu's "Add a drawer here". Its mode
 * (buffer, strict, product, trash) makes no difference.
 *
 * Who gets rewired, and nothing more:
 * - ONE feeder or ONE taker: every feeder wires to every taker, so a
 *   pass-through becomes one wire and a drawer splitting one output to
 *   three machines leaves those three fed. At most max(feeders, takers)
 *   wires, never a cross product of both.
 * - several of each, but all from one card and all to one card: the
 *   wires pair off in order. That is a drawn channel split through a
 *   drawer, put back as it was.
 * - anything else (a real junction, several feeders AND several takers)
 *   heals nothing: there is no one wire that says what it meant.
 *
 * A wire is only added if the board would accept it anyway
 * (`buildEdgeBetweenNodes` refuses a slot that does not take the
 * resource), so a drawer bridging two things that cannot meet directly
 * just goes.
