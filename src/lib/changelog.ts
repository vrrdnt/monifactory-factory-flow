/**
 * What's new, in players' words.
 *
 * Read by people planning factories, not by developers: say what changed on
 * THEIR board, never how it was built. Newest first. ONE entry per release,
 * where a release is a deploy to the live site, not a commit (see version.ts).
 *
 * BE BRIEF. Every note is ONE short sentence naming what changed, and four
 * notes is the ceiling. No second sentence explaining what it used to do, no
 * reasoning, no reassurance: the reader either clicked the chip out of mild
 * curiosity or had the popup put in front of them uninvited, and neither of
 * them asked for an essay. If a change cannot be said in a line, it is
 * probably two changes or one nobody needs told about.
 *
 * The LIST, though, runs all the way back, and that is deliberate. The dialog
 * opens on the releases a given reader has not seen - usually one to four - and
 * keeps the rest behind a "full history" button, so length costs the impatient
 * reader nothing and answers "when did that change?" for everyone else. Do not
 * prune it back to a handful again; that only moved the wall from the archive
 * into the popup for anyone returning after a long break.
 *
 * An entry can also carry ACTIONS: links for anything that lives outside the
 * app, offered as a button because the reader is already right here.

      "Thick lines keep their distance. With line thickness on, wires now leave more room around machines and around each other, instead of using the spacing meant for thin ones and ending up squeezed against the cards.",
      "Where one line crosses another it hops over it with a visible bump, and it is always the thinner line that does the hopping. Those bumps used to go missing on some crossings depending on how the board happened to draw itself, and sometimes appeared on the line hidden underneath; now every crossing gets one and you can always see it.",
