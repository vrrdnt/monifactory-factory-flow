/**
 * The arranger's judge and search: takes an island the layered pass has
 * already placed and rearranges its cards until the wires the router will
 * draw cross as little as possible, and are short after that.
 *
 * The arranger and the router are one system (Jack, 2026-09-08): a layout
 * is only as good as the wires it makes the router draw, and the router
 * prices crossings far above length. So the arranger scores a layout the
 * way the router will see it. Every wire gets a PROXY route shaped like the
 * router's own - leave at the rim point nearest the far end, run straight
 * for the clean cells, take the shortest octilinear way with its one
 * diagonal centred, land straight - and proxy routes are scored IN THE
 * ROUTER'S OWN POINTS (Jack, 2026-09-08: "bring the points into stage
 * one"): length, bends at the turn45/turn90 dials, crossings at the
 * crossing dial weighing the heavier wire, every wire counted its
 * wireWeight (from its width) times over, plus a detour estimate for
 * every card a proxy path would have to go round.
 *
 * The SEARCH keeps the column discipline the layered pass gave the island:
 * a state is the order of cards in each column, each column's vertical
 * offset, the air above each card, and how far along its machine's side
 * each satellite drawer sits. Positions are DERIVED from that by a placer,
 * so every trial is a tidy layout - columns stay columns, rows stay rows.
 * Simulated annealing over swaps, hops to any column flow allows (a drawer
 * may share a column with its partners and sit in the gap between them),
 * moves to a partner's side, and offset nudges hunts the score down; the
 * real router then judges the few best candidates and the fewest actual
 * POINTS wins. The proxy knows the shape of a wire; the router knows the
 * wire.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: the RNG is seeded from the island's ids.
