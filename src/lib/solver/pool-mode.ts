/**
 * POOL MODE: one shared pool per resource, no wires needed.
 *
 * The board is read as a bill of machines rather than a drawing: whatever
 * any machine makes goes into its resource's pool, whatever any machine
 * needs comes out of it, and the surplus banks. The pool is realised as
 * ordinary drawers and ordinary wires inside the solve, so every rule the
 * books already have - conservation, fairness, recycle-before-import,
 * banking - applies unchanged. Nothing here is new physics.
 *
 * Per resource key, exactly one hidden drawer (`pool:<key>`):
 *
 * - every enabled machine OUTPUT of that resource wires INTO it, and every
 *   consumed machine INPUT wires OUT of it. The wires the player drew are
 *   DROPPED (Jack, 2026-09-05): they mean nothing in this mode, the board
 *   fades them out, and they come back untouched when the mode goes off;
 * - a player's SOURCE drawer of that resource wires into it too: the
 *   plan's declared import. A drawer's side is `poolSide` when set, else
 *   what its (now ignored) wires said it was for - see `poolSideOf`;
 * - a player's DRAIN drawer wires out of it: the plan's declared product,
 *   byproduct or trash.
 *
 * Roles then fall out of the wiring the way they do everywhere else. A pool
 * with feeders and takers is an overflow BUFFER, which passes on what its
 * takers pull and banks the rest (the visible +N/s surplus). A pool with
 * feeders only is a PRODUCT drain: what the plan puts out, the free
 * outputs rule for that one resource. A pool with takers and no feeder is
 * a SOURCE: the plan IMPORTS that resource, and the books list it under
 * INPUTS at the rate its takers drink. Pool mode is the deeper solve mode
 * (it needs solve mode on): you pin product amounts or machine counts and
 * the plan does the rest - counts, imports, outputs, wiring.
 *
 * The hidden drawers and wires never reach the board. They ride the solve
 * result (edge and storage figures keyed by their ids) so the cards' rails
 * can read the pool's answer, and every diagnosis that walks the graph is
 * handed this expansion instead of the drawn one.
