/**
 * Synthesized interface sounds for the board - no audio files, everything
 * built from Web Audio oscillators and filtered noise.
 *
 * Sounds mark EVENTS THAT CHANGED THE PLAN (a card landing, a wire snapping
 * in or refusing, a knob turning), never raw UI interaction: a global
 * every-button tick was tried and rejected as noise. The vocabulary lives in
 * `playBoardSound`'s switch; who calls what is the watcher's business
 * (`use-board-sound-effects.ts`) plus the one gesture hook for refusals.
 *
 * Three hard-won rules keep them clean:
 * - Every envelope RAMPS in over a few ms and ramps fully out. A gain that
 *   steps straight to its peak is a click stacked on the note - that was
 *   the first version's "clicky" sound.
 * - Nothing is scheduled against a suspended AudioContext. The context
 *   suspends whenever the tab loses focus or autoplay policy holds it, and
 *   notes scheduled while suspended play late, clipped, or not at all -
 *   that was the "sometimes I don't hear it" bug. `playBoardSound` resumes
 *   first and schedules in the resume callback.
 * - The output stream is KEPT HOT. Chrome (Windows especially) parks the
 *   hardware audio stream after a few seconds of silence while
 *   `currentTime` keeps running, and a 100ms note scheduled into the
 *   wake-up gap is clipped or lost entirely - which reads as "the first
 *   sound played, then nothing". An inaudible constant source holds the
 *   stream open, and every note starts a beat after "now" so it never
 *   begins mid-wakeup.
 * - Fundamentals sit at 200Hz+ (laptop speakers roll off below), and the
 *   whole mix runs through one gentle lowpass so nothing spits.
 * - FIREFOX HANDS THE GRAPH ITS ORDERS AT THE END OF THE TASK. Gecko queues
 *   every node creation, connection and start() and flushes the queue to
 *   the audio thread only when the current task finishes; Chrome's audio
 *   thread picks them up at once. So a note scheduled 30ms ahead by a
 *   click that then solves or renders for 600ms in the same task is, in
 *   Firefox, never heard - its whole envelope is in the past by the time
 *   the graph sees it - and a 150ms hang clips its first 120ms (measured
 *   2026-09-08 with a MediaRecorder on the real output: Chrome played
 *   whole through both, Firefox lost or clipped them, and yielding one
 *   macrotask before the hang played whole). Hence `playBoardSound` on
 *   Gecko schedules from a macrotask of its own, whatever the caller does
 *   next; and callers that can, play first and mutate in a later task
 *   (the mode keys), which puts the note on time as well as whole.
